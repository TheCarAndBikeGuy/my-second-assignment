# my-second-assignment - Ocean Gallery

This is the deployment on GitHub - https://thecarandbikeguy.github.io/my-second-assignment/

I believe that I met the requirements of the thumbnail and main images, styles appropriately with CSS made use of media queries, and used JavaScript to display the images on screen when selected and navigate through them using tab and enter. I also used some display, flex, hover, and audio with some of my buttons. I tried my best to work with the media but feel as though I could have done a better job with it. I found working out which elements I needed in javaScript quite difficult and working out where to put what. 

I think I did well with setting out my buttons for my audio and making sure that they were all aligned and knew what each button does by adding signs instead of writing. I believe I need some practice with JavaScript and some more practice with media as well. I used quite a few sources to help YouTube, w3school, online sound links, and GitHub. I encountered one while trying to skip back to the last one, as it said it was not found but very quickly got that sorted.
